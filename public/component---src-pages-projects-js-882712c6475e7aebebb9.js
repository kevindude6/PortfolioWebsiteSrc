In my past Unity work, I would focus on the mechanics and the gameplay of whatever project I was working on, but that led to a serious imbalance in my knowledge of Unity. I realized that I knew very little about Unity's UI tools, saving and loading, and how different mechanics of a game end up fitting together.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),"  I decided to give myself until the end of April (which, at the time, was about three weeks away) to create a game from start to finish.

I accomplished my goal of learning about aspects of Unity development I was not yet familiar with. Specifically, I learned how to use Unity's UI tools and how to save and load using JSON, but I think the most important thing I learned was how to use ScriptableObjects.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null)," ScriptableObjects were the missing piece of the puzzle for me when it came to Unity. The ability to have game data shared between multiple gameobjects without relying on singletons or managers (for the most part) is incredibly powerful. In addition, event systems built with ScriptableObjects are extremely powerful, and I can't wait to see how else I can use them in the future."),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"project-flexitemtext project-flexitem"},"  In the future, I intend to add more content and a short tutorial, then put the game on the Play Store.
